# Basic-prime-finder-c
A very simple beginner program that takes the users positive integer input and finds all the prime number smaller than the number stated.
Introduction:
This program is meant to be a simple solution to a simple problem, nothing about being efficient, good looking or complex. 
Methods: 
I am using only standard libraries :stdio.h and math.h. Of course using the C programming language, this was written in VS Code 2022.
As for the maths I used the basic method for checking for prime numbers known as the "Trial division" if it interest you can read about it on the internet.
